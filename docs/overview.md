# SmartMotion.nvim Overview

Welcome to the SmartMotion documentation! This plugin is built around the idea that motions should be smart, modular, and composable — allowing you to move through your codebase like a pro with a system you can fully customize.

Below is a high-level summary of what each document covers and how it fits into the ecosystem.

- Future ideas (e.g., multi-buffer collection)

➡️ View [collectors.md](collectors.md)

---

## 🔎 extractors.md

Extractors determine what kind of target you’re looking for.
